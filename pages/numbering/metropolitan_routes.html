                    The Metropolitan Route numbering system is a network of routes that traverse the Melbourne metropolitan area. Routes are given a distinct number which is shown inside of a blue rounded shield. Generally, odd-numbered routes run north-south and increase the further west one goes, and even-numbered routes run east-west and increase the further north one goes, however there are many exceptions to this rule<sup>[1]</sup>. The system commenced use in 1965 and aimed to guide motorists across the Melbourne metropolitan area on the most suitable main roads<sup>[2]</sup>. The Country Roads Board collaborated with the Traffic Commission and the 43 metropolitan councils in early 1964 in order to develop the system<sup>[2]</sup>. 34 Metropolitan Routes were established in 1965, with this number increasing to over 60 by the mid 1990s. Today, 56 Metropolitan Routes remain, with the rest being replaced by alphanumeric routes since 1997.

                    From its inception in 1965 until 1989, few changes were made to the system; some routes were realigned onto newer bypass roads as they opened, such as the Broadmeadows Road Deviation, which forms part of Metropolitan Route 48. In 1970, Freeway Routes were introduced, which used similar shaped shields but with a green colour<sup>[3]</sup>. Freeway Routes were prefixed with an F and numbered between 80 and 90 and were complementary to the Metropolitan Route system. However, they were gradually phased out in the mid 1980s.
                    <br>
                    The system received a major overhaul and expansion in 1989<sup>[4][5]</sup>; 28 new routes were added, many of the existing routes were modified, and Metropolitan Route 2 was removed and converted into Victoria's first Tourist Drive, the Yarra Scenic Drive (Tourist Drive 2)<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>. The most significant additions happened in the outskirts of the urban area, reflecting Melbourne's growth since 1965. Metropolitan Routes 3, 32, 33 and 46 were routed away from the CBD, and Metropolitan Route 40 was expanded to form a complete arterial ring road around the metropolitan area<sup>[5]</sup>.
