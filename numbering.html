                Important road routes in Victoria are assigned a route number. These route numbers are shown on road signs and assist drivers in navigating the road network.

                    Victoria predominantly uses an alphanumeric route numbering system, with a letter indicating the road's importance, and a route number. An example is the M31 Hume Freeway, where the M denotes the route's freeway status and 31 is the route number. This system has been in use since 1997 and is used throughout the entire state except in metropolitan Melbourne, where Metropolitan Route shields are still used on arterial and local roads.

                    <br>
                    The Metropolitan Route numbering system is used on major roads in Melbourne, with the exception of freeways. This system uses a route number inside of a blue shield, and denotes important arterial roads throughout Melbourne. An example is Metropolitan Route 3 which connects Southbank with Mornington via the Nepean Highway.
                    <br>
                    The Metropolitan Route numbering system has been in use since 1965 and has faced many changes over the years. The system received a major overhaul and expansion in 1989, adding new routes to the outskirts of Melbourne and to the Mornington Peninsula, however many of these routes were replaced with alphanumeric routes in 1997. Today, Metropolitan Routes only exist within the urban area, with few exceptions.

                    <br>
                    The National Route numbering system commenced in 1955. Its role was to assist navigation on major interstate highways by denoting them with a route number on a white shield. The National Route system was replaced with alphanumeric routes in 1997, with the exception of Alternate National Route 1 in Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs, which runs from Southbank to Berwick via the Princes Highway/Dandenong Road.

                    In 1974, the Hume and Western Highways were upgraded from National Routes to National Highways, denoting their importance as major interstate routes. In 1992, the Goulburn Valley and Sturt Highways were added to the National Highway system in Victoria, and in 1997, National Highways were replaced with alphanumeric national highway route numbers.

                    Rural highways and major roads that were not already covered by the National Highway/Route system were signed as three-digit State Routes in 1985, using the same shield style as Metropolitan Routes. This system lasted until 1997, where every State Route was replaced with an alphanumeric route number.

                    Freeway Routes were signed on metropolitan freeways using a green shield similar in shape to the Metropolitan Route shields. Freeway Routes were preceded with an F to indicate their freeway nature. The system was progressively phased out in the 1980s, being replaced with National and Metropolitan Route numbers.

                    Tourist Drives are routes through scenic areas and areas of touristic value, and are denoted by a brown pentagonal shield. Tourist Drives are signed independently from other routes. The system has been gradually phased out since the 2000s, however not much is known and Tourist Drives are often poorly documented and signed. In addition to the numbered Tourist Drives, unnumbered tourist routes also exist, such as the Goldfields Tourist Route.
